## Validation

How to tell if you have Helm already installed:

```shell
helm init
```

Results:

```shell
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/thfalgou/.helm.
Warning: Tiller is already installed in the cluster.
(Use --client-only to suppress this message, or --upgrade to upgrade Tiller to the current version.)
Happy Helming!
```
